### Competencies

### Character Traits

### Hobbies

- ⌨️ Mechanical Keyboards
  - [Check out my QMK Fork](https://github.com/jjerrell/qmk_firmware)
    - Updates appear in my fork first. Evetually a PR into my local master is published and reviewed by me. Finally, a PR into the upstream repository is opened. The initial PR will be marked as closed whenever there are no more conflicts after merging upstream master into my fork.
    - This workflow is a pedantic interpretation of their [contribution guidelines](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/contributing).
- 🧐 Technical Analysis of Securities
- 🐢 Investing Responsibly
- ⏳ Making the most of the short amount of time we get to occupy this planet

### Noteworthy Achievements

### Character Testimonies

#### Ryan Durham, Senior Manager of Development

> Jay was an invaluable resource on our team. He has an analytical and exploratory nature that he effectively applies to both business and technical problems. He continually takes the initiative to find solutions for problems we don't know we have yet. Beyond his technical acumen, his background in support prepared him with the communication skills and tact necessary to thrive in a fast paced agile world; collaborating with members of the team, product management, leadership, or directly with a customer - you name it - Jay could do it.

#### Christine Stetler, Implementations Architect

> Jay’s ability to analyze and mitigate complex technical issues is unparalleled. That ability alone makes him an incredibly valuable resource. However, when you couple that with his ability to understand, effectively mitigate and/or explain resolution all the way from the end user to keyboard to user interface to API/interface to code level and back again, you know you’re in the presence of someone valuable and extremely rare. I want Jay on any project I’m involved in and you should too.

#### Myra McIver, Expert Client Account Manager

> I have worked with Jacob Jerrell at Allscripts and he is absolutely great to work with. He possesses a lot of in depth technical expertise that helped solve many of my clients issues that occurred during implementation. He is also very willing to help both his teammates and clients understand the technical requirements for the implementation as well as going above and beyond to ensure that they are successful.
